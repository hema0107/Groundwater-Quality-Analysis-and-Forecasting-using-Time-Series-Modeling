# Groundwater-Quality-Analysis-and-Forecasting-using-Time-Series-Modeling
Developed a data-driven study on groundwater quality trends in India using time series modeling. Implemented ARIMA and Linear Regression to analyze and predict key water parameters like temperature, pH, and conductivity. Performed data preprocessing, outlier detection, and correlation analysis to enhance model accuracy. Visualized trends using time series plots and evaluated model performance using RMSE and MAE. Findings provided insights into water quality variations, supporting sustainable water management and decision-making
